				<h2>Life as Student</h2>
				<p>A studentâ€™s life is a foundation for learning. A student has to face all types of situations and is trained for the future. We learn to obey, respect and discipline ourselves. Our character is shaped during this period. School life is the best and happiest part of every student. We learn academic knowledge, manners, good behaviors, discipline, punctuality, and more. When we get the right education and guidance, we will become well-mannered adults. The student life prepares us with responsibilities for the world outside.</p>
				<p>It is the school where discipline is formed. Most importantly, we acquire knowledge and develop new skills in ourselves. The training from the school life is what makes us turn into better personalities. Student life is the most valuable part in which teachers and parents guide us in the right way and allow us to know what is good and bad for life.</p>

					<h2>My Experience</h2>
					<p>After i checked my UPU result i was very excited because i got to pursue my diploma in UiTM Dungun which is my favourate place. During semester 2, my friends and I got an interview to join a leadership programme under HEP, which is known as Badan Guaman Mahasiswa and all of us passed the interview. I felt that since i joined this leadership programme, everything went smooth to me during my diploma journey. </p>

So, for any discipline cases in UiTM Dungun, the plaintiff need to meet me first to make a report and we need to represent them during the trial. I was very happy because of this, i can help many students who really needs our help to help them in discipline cases. </p>
